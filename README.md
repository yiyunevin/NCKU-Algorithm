# NCKU-Algorithm

## Problem 1

+ Merge Sort 演算法
  + 輸入檔案格式：第一行指定要排序的 key 數量，第二行則為所要排序的 keys
  + 輸出檔案格式：第一行為排序完的 key 數量，接下來每一行則為排序完的 keys

## Problem 2

+ Use C or C++ to implement an insertion sorting algorithm that accepts an input file with the first line indicating the number of keys to be sorted, followed by the list of keys with one line for each key. The algorithm should generate an output file with the number of keys sorted in the first line, followed by the sorted keys with one key in each line.
+ Write a quicksort program in C with the same input/output formats as those in Problem 1.
+ Generate an input that has nearly sorted 10000 numbers. Compare the execution time of your two algorithms in Problems 1 and 2 to see which algorithm runs faster.
+ Implement the algorithm described in the exercise 7.4-5. Check to see if it is faster than both insertion sort and quicksort algorithms by giving the CPU time for the algorithms.
